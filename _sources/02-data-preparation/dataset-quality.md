# Quality of a dataset

What makes a good dataset? An ideal dataset should be:

- **Accurate** - If the data is of high accuracy. Usually the case in chemistry, material science fields.

- **Reliable** - If value for the same material/molecule, under the same conditions, are the same or within an satisfatory error margin.

- **Relevant** - Available variable and properties are well defined for the target problem.

- **Large** - Significantly large amount of data available. This can be an issue in scientific fields as experimental data can be difficult or time consuming to obtain.

- **Have high variability** - Number of possible molecules/materials and their combinations often makes the data limited.

- **Unbiased** - Scientists tend to focus on the good results but ML models need the bad results too.
